* MD5 in SML

** Status

This is currently broken.  I tried to follow the RFC as well as I could,
but now I am pulling my hair, because I keep getting (the same) wrong digests.

** Testing

You can test the work in /lib/ using the tests in /test/.  Use the make file.

#+begin_src sh
  # Uses mlton and takes too long
  make test
  # Fast tests (default is using poly)
  make quicktest
  # use poly or smlnj directly
  make test.poly
  make test.smlnj
#+end_src
